A0P0R4 preview update is coming soon.

Although there are still no available functions at the moment, we will continue to optimize the front-end style.

Here is what's included in this update:

1. 'News' entered the test list

2. 'Community+' has been removed 

3. A lot of cloud interaction functions have been removed


We are resuming all the work, and expect the first preview version with available functions to be launched in October. Note that everything is free."
